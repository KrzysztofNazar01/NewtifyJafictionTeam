## Description
**The goal of this project was to deploy a web application displaying news from database. The user can also use widgets that display data collected from various APIs.**
This project was made during a course entitled “*Javafication: Why is your BEST friend an Object?*“ organized by *BEST* organization. 
## BEST – an international organisation  
"BEST, Board of European Students of Technology is a constantly growing non-profit and non-political organisation. Since 1989 we provide communication, co-operation and exchange possibilities for students all over Europe.
88 Local BEST Groups (LBGs) in 31 countries are creating a growing, well organised, powerful, young and innovative student network.
BEST strives to help European students of technology to become more internationally minded, by reaching a better understanding of European cultures and developing capacities to work on an international basis. Therefore we create opportunities for the students to meet and learn from one another through our academic and non-academic events and educational symposia. "Learning makes the master", but the final goal is a good working place, therefore we offer services like an international career centre to broaden the horizons for the choice on the job market.
Our priority is to offer high quality services for students all over Europe. Thus, we manage to bring all the partners in the "student - company - university" triangle closer.”

## The Course “Javafication: Why is your BEST friend an Object?”
“Throughout the whole year BEST organises different activities where students of technology from member universities get the chance to complement their fields of study, discuss educational matters, learn and take their first steps into an international career, increase their international experience, set up contacts, improve their English level and have fun. Each BEST event is attended by 20-30 engineering and technology students like you, who have something in common: they want to live a unique experience, different from day-to-day school life!”

## Description
To pass the course, we had to create a web application using the SpringBoot and Vaadin frameworks. The project had to be done in a group of 4 participants of the course. The teachers gave us list of tasks to do – each task had an appropriate number of points corresponding to the level of difficulty. 
My team accomplished these tasks:
1.	add unique icons into NavBar tabs for individual topics + implements other views (filter) --> 5 points
2.	reroute to news tab after click on newtify title or icon --> 5 points
3.	add ordinal numbers in Namedays widget (13th of July) --> 2 points
4.	component with input which validates whether email is valid --> 5 points
5.	add button to article widget to open native mail client (bonus with already predefined field content (article text, title as subject) --> 10 points
6.	connect to any public API and represent its response into custom widget (3 times) --> 30 points
